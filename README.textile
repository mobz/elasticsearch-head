h4. Alternatives

h5. Running from the filesystem

elastisearch-head is a standalone webapp written in good-ol' html5. This means, you can put it up on any webserver, run it directly from the filesystem, use it on an ipad, or put it on a floppy disk and carry it with you.

h4. URL Parameters

Parameters may be appended to the url set some initial state eg. @head/index.html?base_uri=http://node-01.example.com:9200@

* @base_uri@ force elasticsearch-head to connect to a particular node.
* @auth_user@ adds basic auth credentials to http requests ( requires "elasticsearch-http-basic":https://github.com/karussell/elasticsearch-http-basic plugin or a reverse proxy )
* @auth_password@ basic auth password as above (note: without "additional security layers":http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/988/is-basic-auth-secure-if-done-over-https, passwords are sent over the network *in the clear* )

h4. Contributing

To contribute to elasticsearch-head you will need the following developer tools

# git and a "github":https://github.com/ account
# "node ( including npm )":http://nodejs.org/download
# "grunt-cli":http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

Then

# create a fork of elasticsearch-head on github
# clone your fork to your machine
# @cd elasticsearch-head@
# @npm install@ # downloads node dev dependencies
# @grunt default watch@ # builds the distribution files, then watches the src directory for changes

Changes to both dist and src directories *must* be committed, to allow people to run head without running dev tools
and folllow existing dev patterns, such as indenting with tabs
