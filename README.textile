* is available at "http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/":http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/ (or whatever the address of your cluster is)
* Will not work with elasticsearch prior to version 0.17

h4. Running as a standalone webapp

* @git clone git://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head.git@
* @cd elasticsearch-head@
* @open index.html@

This will manually download the latest version of elasticsearch-head from github and run it standalone. In this mode;
* elasticsearch-head is running from the file system and some features will not work
* may have trouble connecting to the node if the node is protected by some security measures
* works with any version of elasticsearch

h4. Alternatives

elastisearch-head is a standalone webapp written in good-ol' html5. This means, you can put it up on any webserver, run it directly from the filesystem, use it on an ipad, or put it on a floppy disk and carry it with you.
